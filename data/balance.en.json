  "general": "Today, the Moon in Virgo creates unbalanced aspects with Pluto and Mars, dear Libra. Your ego may be put to the test, and while you may feel a need for attention, the motivation to work on projects that could enhance your popularity may be lacking. This is a favorable time to explore your thought patterns, especially if you tend to judge your peers. Ask yourself about the value of your energy when negative thoughts about others cross your mind. Consider reframing your personal narrative by breaking down your goals into small and sustainable steps.",
