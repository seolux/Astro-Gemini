  "general": "This morning, the energy may seem slightly tense, dear Libra. The Moon in Leo forms aspects with Venus, Mercury, and Chiron, encouraging you to treat others as you would like to be treated, even if it requires a bit more patience. As the afternoon progresses, Uranus may create tensions, making personalities more conflictual. It is therefore essential to set clear boundaries and step away from dramas before they intensify. In the evening, with the Moon entering Virgo, a moment of solitude will be beneficial for you to refocus.",
