With the alignment of the Moon in Virgo and Jupiter, take a moment to reflect on how you can propel these successes even further. In the afternoon, when the Moon, Venus, and Chiron form a yod, nourish your own interests to enrich your romantic relationships. Your confidence and creative satisfaction will allow your connections to flourish. This evening, Uranus brings you a sudden surge of personal power, helping you break free from unhealthy cycles. Plan to start your bedtime routines early, as Saturn may disrupt your sleep tonight.",
