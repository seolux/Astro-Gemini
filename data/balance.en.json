  "general": "Dear Libra, the Moon in Aries awakens passionate vibrations within you. Your heart yearns for excitement, but it is crucial to remain vigilant in your quest. A challenging square between Luna and Jupiter may cloud your judgment, making it easier to ignore warning signals or to lose yourself in a new relationship. Take the time to build trust with new acquaintances. If you are already in a relationship, it may be time to contemplate a fresh start. Steer clear of intense connections and favor simple, gentle moments, especially when Chiron activates this evening.",
