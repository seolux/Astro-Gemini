  "general": "Today, sudden changes in your circumstances force you to reevaluate your priorities, dear Aries. It is essential to get your affairs in order as the Moon in Pisces forms aspects with Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune before entering your sign. Mars entering Aquarius expands your reach over the next few weeks, and the spotlight is on you. Be mindful to present a strong and determined image to gain the approval of your colleagues. Eliminate negative influences as the Sun and Pluto unite, and dedicate more time to those who support you. Use this day to expand your network, especially as Mercury becomes active this afternoon. In the evening, a bit of flirting awaits you as Venus fills the air with romance.",
  "love": "Let yourself indulge in romance and flirting tonight.",
