  "general": "This morning, the Moon in Virgo aligns with Jupiter, encouraging you to take a moment to connect with your emotional and physical needs before diving into the day. Later, a rare yod forms between the Moon, Venus, and Chiron, urging you to reach out to your community and offer your assistance to those in need. Collective efforts will be greatly rewarded. In the evening, unexpected and joyful blessings will brighten your spirit, but be mindful not to stay up too late when Saturn becomes more restless, as it may hinder your productivity tomorrow.",
