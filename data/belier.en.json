  "general": "The entry of the Moon into Taurus immerses you in a soothing atmosphere, dear Aries. Take the time to slow down your pace and appreciate the small pleasures of life, but with intention. Avoid crowded places that could spark frustration, especially with the agitation of Mars and Pluto this afternoon. Digital interactions may not be any more serene; it would be wise to keep a low profile and simplify your exchanges for now. Screen fatigue will be felt under the quarter Moon this evening. You might feel a need to break free from technology, which could provoke some anxiety as Monday approaches. Instead of dreading your responsibilities for tomorrow, focus on the present moment and savor it fully.",
