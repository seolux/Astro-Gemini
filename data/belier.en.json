  "general": "This morning, you may find it challenging to set aside your own desires to meet the needs of others, dear Aries. The Moon in Cancer and Chiron create a tension that could foster resentment. Take a moment to reflect on a healing path that suits everyone. In the afternoon, a change of pace could bring solutions, with the activation of Uranus and Saturn. Enjoy your lunch break to connect playfully and treat yourself to small delights that will uplift your mood. As the evening approaches, the Moon enters Leo and aligns with Neptune, inviting you to unleash your creativity and bring your visions to life in a dreamy atmosphere. However, be cautious, as a certain drama may unfold tonight when Pluto stirs, threatening to burn valuable bridges.",
