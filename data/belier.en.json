  "general": "This morning, a competitive energy manifests, dear Aries, as Mars stirs in your eleventh solar house. Be cautious of peers who may attempt to overshadow you to pursue their own desires. Avoid fueling tensions that could leave you feeling restless. The atmosphere intensifies with the full moon in Leo, thereby unleashing your creative potential. Step back from current events, trends, and popular culture to rediscover your voice. Draw your inspiration from what truly resonates with you, rather than trying to blend into the collective. Embracing authentic interests will allow your heart to flourish.",
