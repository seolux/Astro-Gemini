  "general": "Today, dear Aries, opinions may easily change and are likely to provoke conflicts. With the Moon in Gemini and the Sun in Aquarius, it is essential to weigh your words and decisions carefully. Situations requiring teamwork may seem particularly challenging, and hiding behind your concerns will not be an option. If resolutions cannot be found, consider voting to determine a majority. However, starting in the afternoon, the mood improves thanks to the favorable aspects between the Moon, Mercury, and Venus. If tensions persist, take the initiative to restore peace. Showing your egalitarian side will earn you the respect of your peers and perhaps the attention of a new admirer.",
