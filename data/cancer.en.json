  "general": "Today, unexpected acts of kindness float in the air and will bring you rewards, dear Cancer. The Moon in Pisces forms aspects with Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune before moving into Aries. This is the perfect time to seek favors from those who owe you something. Expect a lot of movement and transformation in the weeks to come with the entry of Mars into Aquarius. Set aside your ego and do not resist change. Prepare yourself mentally to act quickly if opportunities arise. Release the versions of yourself that hold you back, as the Sun and Pluto unite. Take care of your needs while respecting what others require to feel secure, especially when Mercury and Venus activate later in the day.",
