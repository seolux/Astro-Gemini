  "general": "Dear Capricorns, opportunities present themselves to you, but they may disappear quickly. The Moon in Pisces influences Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune, creating a climate conducive to reflection and innovation. The entry of the Moon into Aries urges you to structure your ideas and prepare to act when an occasion arises. With Mars exiting your sign, the union of the Sun in Aquarius and Pluto accelerates your environment. Focus on the people and projects that inspire you to stay in tune with the world around you in the coming weeks.",
