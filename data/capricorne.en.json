  "general": "Today, dear Capricorn, you will feel a strong determination towards the personal and financial investments you have made. However, the confrontation between the Moon and Mars invites you to reflect: is your vision too limited? Staying focused on your goals is crucial, but do not forget that it can be beneficial to be flexible and explore new possibilities. With the full moon in Leo, the time is ripe to welcome transformation. Unveil the layers of your world and identify areas for improvement. If your pride has prevented you from exploring new directions, begin to let go of these constraints over the next six months.",
