  "general": "Today, take a moment to appreciate what you already have before asking the universe to bring new blessings. The Moon in Virgo forms unbalanced aspects with Pluto and Mars, which may lead you to dream of better opportunities while allowing your surroundings to seem barren. Be vigilant and do not lose sight of the precious resources at your disposal, as this could result in an unnecessary drain on your finances. Try to breathe new life into old items, projects, or goals before embarking on new adventures. Luck is on your side as the nodes of fate awaken, and past wishes may finally come to fruition, even if your aspirations have evolved.",
