  "general": "Dear Gemini, allow yourself to feel at ease today. The Moon in Virgo and the alignment of Jupiter enhance your sense of aesthetics and your appreciation of beauty. This is the perfect time to express your affection towards those who form your support system. This afternoon, the Moon, Venus, and Chiron form a yod, urging you to honor both your blood family and the family you have chosen, thus nourishing your soul. In the evening, you will be in a playful mindset but also seeking moments of solitude, so focus on enjoyment at home. However, be cautious, as the energy may become more distant when Saturn begins to stir, and you might need some time to unwind before sleeping.",
