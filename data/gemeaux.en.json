  "general": "Mars brings a wave of activity to your day, dear Gemini, flooding you with opportunities, blessings, and a sense of urgency. A promising turning point in events stirs excitement, but haste could hinder your ability to make informed decisions. While you are not afraid to learn from your mistakes, a little reflection could save you from course corrections later. Fortunately, your intuition strengthens as the full moon in Leo approaches. Pay attention to the synchronicities that will mark your day and maintain an open dialogue with your intuition. Seeking guidance from another dimension could be the key to unlocking new horizons.",
