  "general": "Dear Gemini, reality checks are on the horizon today as the Moon in Taurus aligns with the nodes of destiny, Mercury, and Venus. While it is essential to approach your major goals with a thoughtful or spiritual perspective, the energies of the day encourage you to take matters into your own hands. Luck may sometimes elude you, but responsible planning and a willingness to evolve will lead you to success on your own terms. Furthermore, with Neptune entering Aries, your perception of dreams and hope will change over the next fourteen years, bringing a renewal in your social circle with dreamy and exhilarating connections. Take a moment to meditate on your gratitudes to attract even more blessings, especially as the Moon aligns with Jupiter this evening.",
