  "general": "This morning, friends will turn to you for advice or support, dear Gemini. The Moon in Leo aligns with Venus, Mercury, and Chiron, allowing you to feel great satisfaction in being the confidant of those around you. However, be careful not to let your thoughts overwhelm you, especially as Uranus brings a gust of chaos in the mid-afternoon. Embrace this turbulence to retreat and focus on healthy distractions. Once the Moon enters Virgo this evening, invest energy into your home.",

  "work": "Avoid rushing into professional decisions today.",
  "health": "Take time to relax and center yourself.",
