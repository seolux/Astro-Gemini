  "general": "Dear Gemini, today, Mercury and Venus unite in your ninth solar house, urging you to believe in magic. This is the perfect time to make wishes, hold great hopes, and propel yourself forward. You will receive guidance and blessings throughout the day if you move thoughtfully and with an open heart. As the Moon transits in your sign and aligns with Chiron, helping hands will present themselves. Do not hesitate to ask for assistance from your community when you feel the need. Do not be discouraged if not everyone supports you, especially with Saturn's unrest. Conclude your day with a small comforting pleasure when the Moon enters Cancer.",
