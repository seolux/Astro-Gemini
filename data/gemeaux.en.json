The Moon in Pisces forms connections with Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune before moving into Aries, infusing new energy into your social life. With Mars entering Aquarius, your ninth solar house activates, encouraging you to embrace mindfulness and move forward with determination. Remember that every ending opens the door to new beginnings, especially with the union of the Sun and Pluto. It's time to make peace with people or situations that weigh you down. Take advantage of the day to socialize, as Mercury and Venus activate, bringing luck to your friendly and romantic interactions.",
