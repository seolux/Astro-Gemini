  "general": "Dear Gemini, you may feel overwhelmed by too many options today as the Moon aligns with the Sun and the nodes of fate. Your emotional and practical thoughts might pull you in opposite directions, making it difficult for you to progress. If the answers are not clear within you, take a step back to meditate or seek advice. In the afternoon, with the alignment of the Moon with Mercury and Venus, seeking wise opinions will be facilitated. Remember that, even when consulting a trusted advisor, it is up to you to draw your own conclusions. With the Moon active in your sign, trust your intuition; it will guide you.",
