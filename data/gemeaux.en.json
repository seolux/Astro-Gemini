  "general": "Spread your wings and explore new horizons, dear Gemini. The Moon in Aries activates your eleventh solar house, and your soul longs for new experiences and the establishment of new friendships. Consider putting yourself forward to weave connections. If your local community feels limited, do not hesitate to turn to digital spaces to expand your circle. Remember to step outside and enjoy the fresh air when Luna forms an aspect with Jupiter in the mid-afternoon. Absorb the energy of the earth while cultivating your gratitude to make the most of these vibrations. When Chiron awakens this evening, free yourself from grudges and embrace forgiveness, even if these changes start within you.",
