  "general": "Today, sparkling personalities encourage you to come out of your shell, dear Gemini. The Moon in Pisces forms aspects with Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune before moving into Aries, bringing a fresh energy to your social circle. Meanwhile, Mars enters Aquarius, energizing your ninth solar house. This is the time to embrace mindfulness and move forward with intention in the weeks to come to collaborate with the forces of the universe and manifest your dreams. Remember that every ending heralds a new beginning when the Sun and Pluto unite. Make peace with those people or situations you can no longer support. Enjoy the day to socialize, as Mercury and Venus activate, bringing luck to your social and romantic interactions.",
