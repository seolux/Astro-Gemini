  "general": "Dear Gemini, do not let minor annoyances hold you back today. As the Moon in Virgo forms unbalanced aspects with Pluto and Mars, stress may increase and your tendency towards perfectionism will manifest more strongly. While it is crucial to treat your dreams with the care they deserve, keep in mind that it is sometimes necessary to adapt when things do not go as planned. You will feel a desire for renewal, especially with the activation of the nodes of fate. However, be careful, intense emotions may push you to restrict your creative impulses.",
