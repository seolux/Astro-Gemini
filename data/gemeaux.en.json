  "general": "This morning, the moon in Cancer and Chiron clash, dear Gemini, indicating a need to take a break from screens. Put away your devices and let the real world sharpen your senses and revitalize your spirit. Sparks of genius will provide solutions to problems that have left you puzzled, thanks to the assistance of Uranus and Saturn. When 'ah-ha' moments arise, pause to fully absorb them and plan your next steps. Your aura will shine in the company of friends when the moon enters Leo and forms an aspect with Neptune this evening. Prepare for change and be mindful of what you wish for when Pluto stirs later tonight.",
