  "general": "The moon in Pisces creates a cosmic atmosphere conducive to optimism. You are encouraged to look towards the future with confidence. The structures you have put in place are solid, and this is the ideal time to take a calculated risk. With the entry of Mars into Aquarius, love presents itself as a powerful driving force, promising passionate exchanges in the weeks to come. However, be cautious not to let infidelity or obsession influence your relationships, especially with the union of the Sun and Pluto. Take the time to reflect on how your relationships can shape your life before fully committing. Spiritual exchanges will uplift you when Mercury and Venus activate later in the day.",
