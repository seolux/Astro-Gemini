  "general": "Dear Lions, today is a day to examine how your partnerships influence your journey. The Moon in Cancer aligns with Chiron, Uranus, and Saturn, urging you to take a step back and evaluate your goals and relationships. Imbalances may manifest, and it is essential to address them. Fortunately, your loved ones will be ready to collaborate in establishing beneficial structures for both of you. Share your hopes and dreams to support one another. In the evening, the Moon enters your sign and creates a beautiful connection with Neptune, infusing your aura with dreamy vibrations. You will have the power to enchant, but be careful not to mislead others as Pluto stirs this evening.",
