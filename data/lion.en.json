  "general": "Today, dear Leo, it is essential to be attentive to the influence of others on your well-being. The Moon in Gemini and the Sun in Aquarius activate collective energies that may cause you to oscillate between different emotional states. If you feel a certain agitation or if you are overwhelmed by external stimuli, do not hesitate to take a step back. Disconnect from screens and refocus to regain your emotional balance. Enjoy moments of conviviality with friends or allow yourself a bit of flirting this afternoon when Mercury and Venus align.",
