  "general": "This morning, relationships may become complicated, dear Pisces, as the Moon in Gemini and the Sun in Aquarius, accompanied by the nodes of fate, activate emotional tensions. If you are struggling to understand your loved ones and vice versa, taking a moment alone may bring you the clarity you need. In the afternoon, communication improves thanks to the influence of Mercury and Venus, offering an open and compassionate energy. However, be cautious when approaching delicate subjects in public, as prying ears may prompt you to withdraw within yourself. Dedicate your evening to gentle and restorative activities at home to recharge your heart and mind.",
