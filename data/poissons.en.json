  "general": "Dear Pisces, today is a favorable day to trust your instincts. The movements of the Moon in aspect with Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune create an opportunity. Take advantage of this period to lay solid foundations for your new projects. Once Mars enters Aquarius, it will be crucial to bring your visions to life in the coming weeks. Take the time to step away from the spotlight to maintain your focus. The powerful encounter between the Sun and Pluto will help you release unnecessary patterns, paving the way for significant revelations and true empowerment. Remember that your thoughts shape your reality, so be kind to yourself as Mercury and Venus come into play later in the day.",
