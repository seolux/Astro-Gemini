  "general": "Dear Pisces, today your obsessive tendencies may lead you to make poor decisions. As Mars and the Moon clash in the sky, an excessive focus on details and repressed energy may disrupt your judgment. Focus on simple tasks that allow you to release before mistakes occur. With the full moon in Leo approaching, the atmosphere becomes more intense. Be sure to take care of your body to avoid stress. Pay attention to signs of tension, shortness of breath, or racing thoughts. This moon phase offers you the opportunity to develop new coping mechanisms in the face of life's challenges, but it is essential to find healthy ways to manage your triggers.",
