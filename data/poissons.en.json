  "general": "This morning, the Moon in Cancer and Chiron oppose each other, amplifying a sense of discontent. Emotional wounds may make gratitude difficult, but grant yourself the grace to heal at your own pace. From the afternoon, Uranus and Saturn highlight your resilient and playful spirit. Laughter could be the remedy your soul needs to free itself from fear or sadness. Enjoy this energy by spending time with a close friend to recharge. As the Moon enters Leo and forms an aspect with Neptune, you will become increasingly optimistic about the goals you have set, inspiring you to take sustainable actions to realize your dreams. This evening, avoid getting caught up in minor details as Pluto awakens.",
