  "general": "Today, dear Pisces, you will feel the happiest in your little inner world. With Mercury and Venus aligning in the sector of your chart that governs introspection, solitude will bring you great benefits. Your focus will be heightened, with no distractions to divert you from your path, helping you to manifest grand visions. You will also feel the need to connect with trusted allies, so do not hesitate to take breaks to interact with your close friends. Nourish your heart with nostalgic pleasures as the Moon in Gemini aligns with Chiron. This afternoon, Saturn will remind you that you are responsible for your own path to success. Prepare to change course and prioritize pleasure when the Moon enters Cancer later in the day.",
