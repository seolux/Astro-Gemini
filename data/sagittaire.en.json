  "general": "Today, dear Sagittarius, it is time to take stock of your multiple passions and interests. The Moon in Aries illuminates your house of talent and personal expression, thus fostering creativity. However, a lack of clear vision may leave you with unfinished projects that never reach their full potential. Focus on one or two artistic ideas to fully engage yourself. As the afternoon approaches, the energy may become a bit nervous, creating a need for you to relax. Enjoy an outing with friends, but avoid competitive dynamics. In the evening, when Chiron comes into play, take the time to connect to your heart and listen to its healing needs.",
