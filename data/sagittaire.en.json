  "general": "Do not exhaust yourself trying to keep up with others, dear Sagittarius. With the Moon in Taurus influencing the nodes of fate, Mercury, and Venus, taking care of yourself will be more beneficial than pushing your limits. You will have plenty of time to catch up once you have rested. Over the coming years, your heart will experience many changes after Neptune enters Aries. The dreams you pursue are likely to evolve, and it will be essential to honor your natural talents rather than forcing skills that do not come naturally. Plan a healthy activity with someone dear to you this evening when the Moon aligns with Jupiter.",
  "love": "Take the time to connect deeply with your partner. A quiet outing will strengthen your bonds.",
  "work": "Avoid comparing yourself to your colleagues; focus on your own goals and move forward at your own pace.",
  "health": "Plan a relaxing activity that will allow you to recharge, such as a nature walk or yoga.",
  "advice": "Listen to your body and give yourself breaks.",
