  "general": "Dear Sagittarians, today you will feel the need to connect deeply with your loved ones. The influences of Mercury and Venus encourage you to ensure that every interaction is meaningful. Do not settle for superficial conversations; showcase your sharp mind and unique perspective, as this may well captivate the person you are drawn to. Remember to cherish yourself first, especially with the favorable aspect between the Moon in Gemini and Chiron. On the other hand, the arrival of Saturn this afternoon may bring you back to your responsibilities, so stay focused on what is essential rather than getting lost in romantic dreams. By the end of the day, the Moon enters Cancer, urging you to make powerful moves in your life.",
