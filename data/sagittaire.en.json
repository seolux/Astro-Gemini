  "general": "Today, dear Sagittarius, wounded egos may trigger a certain mood, particularly under the influence of the Moon in Cancer opposing Chiron. If you wake up on the wrong side of the bed, allow yourself the time to rest to avoid overreacting. Early afternoon, with the activation of Uranus and Saturn, engage in a project related to your home or collaborate with a partner. Staying productive will revitalize the energy flowing within you. Later, a soothing peace will envelop you as the Moon enters Leo and forms aspects with Neptune, bringing forth new passions as Pluto stirs in the evening, inspiring your next grand adventure.",
