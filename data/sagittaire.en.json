  "general": "Dear Sagittarius, today, your desire to build a solid reputation will be heightened by the alignment of the Moon in Virgo with Pluto and Mars. This energy may give you a sense of urgency, but be cautious of missteps that could occur when all eyes are on you. Remember that the best ideas require time and patience to be implemented. Do not rush to the finish line, as it may harm your image among your peers. When inspiration manifests, allow your projects to mature in order to refine the missing details. Take the time to rest this evening to return with a renewed and in-control spirit.",
