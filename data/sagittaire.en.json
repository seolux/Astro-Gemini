  "general": "Dear Sagittarius, your spirit shines today under the clash between Mars and the Moon, triggering an urgent need for movement. The excitement of new possibilities can be both exhilarating and overstimulating for your senses. It is crucial to think before acting, as impulsive decisions could lead to incomplete visions or a sense of chaos. Fortunately, the full moon in Leo connects you to your higher self. Take advantage of this lunar phase to slow down, reflect on your dreams, and set clear goals for the next six months.",
