  "general": "Dear Scorpio, health and well-being should become an integral part of your spiritual path today, as the Moon in Cancer aligns with Chiron. You will feel a desire for adventure, especially when Uranus and Saturn come into play this afternoon. Your loved ones will be eager to accompany you in your explorations. It is also a good time to nourish your creative aspirations, especially if you are considering collaborations. The energies are favorable for gathering artistic minds, but it may be up to you to take the reins. Establish a structured plan that harmonizes your schedules and visions, so that the true work can begin. The pieces of your puzzle will come together harmoniously when the Moon enters Leo and aligns with Neptune. Take time to rest at home this evening, as Pluto's movement may plunge you into intense emotions.",
