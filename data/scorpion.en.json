  "general": "Dear Scorpio, today it is essential to integrate pleasure, romance, and creativity into your daily life. The Moon in Pisces aligns with Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune, thus offering you the possibility to manifest your best life. Consider making improvements to your home, especially when Mars enters Aquarius. Your family matters will require more attention, but you will receive as much support as you give. Honor your ancestors while celebrating your uniqueness when the Sun and Pluto converge. Remember to play with your routines when Mercury and Venus activate later in the day, promoting socialization and self-care.",
