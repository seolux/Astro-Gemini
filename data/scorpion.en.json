  "general": "This morning, your connections reveal themselves to be precious, dear Scorpio, thanks to a beautiful harmony between the Moon in Virgo and Jupiter. Take this moment to catch up with your peers, as an exciting opportunity may present itself. From the afternoon, orient yourself towards circles where compassion and well-being are priorities. The Moon forms a rare yod with Venus and Chiron, placing you in a mindset conducive to community and well-being. This evening, romantic interactions and unexpected flirts may arise when Uranus comes into play. However, be careful not to give in to the temptation of staying up late scrolling through your social media or sending messages, as the Moon opposes responsible Saturn.",
