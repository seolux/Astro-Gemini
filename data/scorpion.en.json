  "general": "Show special attention to your family and childhood friends today, dear Scorpio. With the alliance of Mercury and Venus, a warmth radiates from your home and close bonds, qualities you won't find anywhere else. If you feel a bit melancholic, let love uplift you. Also, allow yourself some rest if your energy has recently diminished. A beautiful connection between the Moon in Gemini and Chiron encourages you to integrate small moments of well-being into your schedule. Although the atmosphere may become more rigid this afternoon with Saturn's activation, it is important to focus on yourself rather than pushing others to open up. Your world will become lighter and full of possibilities after the Moon enters Cancer later in the day.",
