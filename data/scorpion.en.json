The Moon in Pisces aligns with Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune, offering you manifesting power to realize your ideal life. Start by making improvements to your home as Mars enters Aquarius. Your family life will require more attention, but know that you will receive as much support as you give. By honoring your ancestors while celebrating your uniqueness, you may feel a profound flourishing. Later in the day, as Mercury and Venus activate, have fun reinventing your routines by adding moments of socialization and self-care.",
