  "general": "Dear Scorpio, today tensions may escalate quickly if you allow gloomy moods to take hold. With the Moon and Mars in opposition, it is essential to exercise personal restraint. Although your loved ones may test your patience, an emotional outburst will only worsen the situation. The full moon in Leo reminds us that there are always two sides to every story, but avoid dramatizing yours. The atmosphere may feel intense, but you have the power to end the day on a positive note. Set clear boundaries and steer conversations towards nourishing interactions.",
