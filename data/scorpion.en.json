  "general": "Dear Scorpios, today it is crucial to manage stress with healthy coping mechanisms. The Moon in Leo influences your well-being by aspecting Venus, Mercury, and Chiron. Listen to your body and prioritize a diet that promotes relaxation. Consider adopting structured routines to reduce tension. Expect surprising revelations that could shake your perception of loved ones or those you admire, especially when Uranus comes into play this afternoon. Stay calm and allow those around you the time to justify themselves before jumping to hasty conclusions. In the evening, when the Moon settles in Virgo, feel free to organize a friendly gathering with your friends.",
