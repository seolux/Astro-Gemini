  "general": "Dear Scorpio, today will be a day rich in emotions as you interact with others. The Moon in Virgo creates tensions with Pluto and Mars, urging you to pay attention to your well-being. Be aware of how your energy shifts throughout encounters. Avoid introducing disruptive elements into your personal space, as this could add to the chaos of your day. If an unpleasant interaction disturbs you, take the time to release that residual energy. Memories from the past may resurface, so open your heart to old friends while leaving behind toxic connections.",
