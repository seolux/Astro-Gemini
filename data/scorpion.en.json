  "general": "The moon in Cancer and the nodes of destiny urge you to listen to what your heart desires, dear Scorpio. Although external circumstances beyond your control may have created some obstacles, the only acceptable path to follow is the one illuminated by your intuition. It is essential to embrace spiritual practices to align yourself with the universe, placing your faith in the divine powers that flow within you and around you.
