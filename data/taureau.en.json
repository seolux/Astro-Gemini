  "general": "Today, dear Taurus, embrace a gradual approach to your agenda. The Moon in Leo forms aspects with Venus, Mercury, and Chiron, inviting you to savor moments of tranquility. Solitude can be a valuable source of spiritual regeneration. However, in the mid-afternoon, Uranus may make you a bit more irritable than usual. Those who know your sensitive points might attempt to provoke you. Stay calm and set clear boundaries to avoid unnecessary conflicts. As night falls, when the Moon enters Virgo, focus on your exciting projects and hobbies, which will bring you great satisfaction.",
