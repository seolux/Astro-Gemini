You will feel an inner light illuminating you, making it easier for others to discover your true essence. However, it is important to recognize the work that lies ahead, especially with the activation of Mars and Pluto later in the day. Your determination will be your ally in difficult moments, but be wary of the frustration that may arise if you feel that others are holding you back. If impatience arises, take a moment to reflect on its origin. Tonight, the first quarter of the Moon will shed light on the obstacles you encounter, allowing you to identify the best way to navigate around them.",
