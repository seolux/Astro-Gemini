  "general": "Dear Taurus, begin your day by reciting positive mantras and setting clear intentions. The Moon in Cancer and Chiron clash, which may make you feel nostalgic. Seek playful distractions, especially this afternoon when Uranus and Saturn mingle with your energy. Plan gatherings with friends to stimulate your creativity and broaden your horizons. In the evening, the atmosphere warms up with the entrance of the Moon in Leo, urging you towards the comfort of your home. A tender connection with Neptune invites you to solitude and the security of your abode. However, be cautious of uncontrolled emotions that could become destructive this evening, as Pluto reveals its agitation.",
