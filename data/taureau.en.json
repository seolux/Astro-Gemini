  "general": "Today, dear Taurus, you may feel inclined towards solitude as the Moon moves through Aries. Do not hesitate to venture alone, especially if you feel the need for space. This moment of introspection could lead you to realize that it is time to embrace new beginnings. Focus on finalizing the details before moving on to the next step. Unexpected discoveries may shift your perspective throughout the day, especially when the Moon forms a square with Jupiter in the afternoon. Follow your intuition and ask questions to fill in the gaps. By the end of the day, Chiron will remind you that every healing journey begins from within. Take the time to meditate on what you need to feel whole and ready for the next chapter.",
