  "general": "Dear Taurus, professional alliances reveal themselves as precious today, as Mercury and Venus unite. Remember that individual success often forms part of a collective effort; appreciate the support network that helps you progress. In matters of the heart, take time to discuss your shared goals with your partner and the time needed to achieve them. A gentle connection between the Moon in Gemini and Chiron enhances your self-esteem, facilitating the expression of your desires and what you deserve. You may feel slightly out of sync when Saturn manifests this afternoon, but do not strive to fit in where you do not feel comfortable. The arrival of the Moon in Cancer brings a touch of compassion in the air, softening your interactions.",
