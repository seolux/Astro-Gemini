  "general": "Dear Taureans, fateful encounters may guide you towards a new social dynamic today. The Moon in Cancer and the nodes of destiny align to support your aspirations in cultural, creative, or intellectual spheres. Be attuned to your intuition to capture the subtle details that others share; this will help you better understand your audience. However, take the time to develop these new relationships, as the unbalanced aspects of Luna, Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus suggest it is best to avoid revealing yourself too quickly. An instant connection may awaken a strong desire for bonding, but remain vigilant against those who may have hidden intentions.",
  "love": "Take the time to get to know the other before committing.",

  "health": "Pay attention to your emotional well-being, practice meditation.",
