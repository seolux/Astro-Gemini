  "general": "This morning, Mars creates a stir that brings a sense of urgency. Patience, dear Taurus! Every obstacle must be approached with respect and wisdom. Instead of rushing headlong, adopt a thoughtful approach to overcome challenges. The full moon in Leo, which will rise later in the day, will highlight the importance of rest. This astrological event may cause exhaustion and unpredictable mood swings. Listen to your needs and do not ignore them, for the light of Luna calls you to slow down and center yourself. End your day surrounded by comfort and softness.",
