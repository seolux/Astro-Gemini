  "general": "This day begins chaotically, dear Taurus. The Moon interacts with the nodes of fate, Mercury, and Venus, which may disrupt projects you have been working on in the shadows. These unexpected events invite you to take a step back and reevaluate your priorities. A major turning point is approaching as Neptune enters Aries, marking a significant period of introspection and mental readjustment. The next fourteen years will profoundly transform your vision of yourself, your dreams, and the cycles that rhythm your existence. Allow your optimistic side to take the reins and consider new adventures when the Moon aligns with Jupiter in the evening.",
