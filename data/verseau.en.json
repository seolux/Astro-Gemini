  "general": "Today, Mercury and Venus meet in your sign, dear Aquarius, enhancing your charisma and communication skills. Take a moment to align yourself with your desires before starting the day. Reflect on how you can use your voice to advance your projects. Your confidence grows as you explore subjects or hobbies that ignite your passion. However, be vigilant about your spending this afternoon, as Saturn may stir tensions. Rather than investing in new possessions, try working with what you have. Your intuition will sharpen when the Moon enters Cancer later in the day, improving your ability to make pragmatic decisions.",
