  "general": "Today, dear Aquarius, the importance of healthy communication takes center stage. Be careful with your words, especially if you have nothing kind to say. The Moon in Cancer and Chiron urge you to reflect before expressing yourself. If you owe apologies but find it hard to articulate them, affectionate gestures may prove more powerful. Sweet surprises can ease tensions when Uranus and Saturn come into play this afternoon. Remember that honesty and responsibility are essential for your personal growth and relationships. Love blossoms as the Moon enters Leo and connects with Neptune, putting you in a joyful mindset. This evening, try to see others through a positive yet realistic lens as Pluto stirs.",
