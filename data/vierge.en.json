  "general": "Dear Virgo, today, avoid social hierarchies and online platforms that have taken a toxic turn. With the Moon in Cancer and Chiron in discord, prioritize your positive interactions. Love and friendship will bring you a refreshing dose of hope. In the afternoon, Uranus and Saturn favor adventures in unknown places with a loved one. Seize this opportunity to explore new experiences together. As the Moon enters Leo and aligns with Neptune, your thoughts turn towards the imaginary. However, remain vigilant against unhealthy indulgences when Pluto activates later in the night.",
