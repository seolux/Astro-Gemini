  "general": "The universe is activating to restore balance in your life, dear Virgo. Be attentive to the signs indicating that it is time to make changes. The Moon in Pisces influences Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune, before entering Aries, which may push you to reassess some of your priorities. With Mars entering Aquarius, you will discover ways to organize the surrounding chaos, even if it requires a period of adjustment. Simplify your daily life by eliminating unnecessary steps, especially when the Sun and Pluto unite. Do not hesitate to ask for help from your colleagues once Mercury activates in the mid-afternoon. Tonight, focus on self-care and allow your loved ones to pamper you.",
