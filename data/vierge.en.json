  "general": "Dear Virgo, today is a day where it is essential to honor your instincts to avoid unnecessary complications. With the Moon in Gemini and the Sun in Aquarius, the celestial alignments remind you that some advice, although well-intentioned, could mislead you. Before you let yourself be swept away by the current, take a moment to consider all your options. Even minor decisions can have significant repercussions, so proceed with caution. If chaos ensues, know that you have the skills necessary to manage situations as they arise. This afternoon, Mercury and Venus activate your sense of organization and work ethic, allowing you to shine in emergency management.",
